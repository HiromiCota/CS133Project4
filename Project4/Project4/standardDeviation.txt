Once your calculator is working, use it to write, run and save an RPN program which goes through the numbers in registers 0 - 6, puts the sum in register 7, the mean (average) in register 8, and the standard deviation in register 9.

Standard deviation is defined as the square root of the variance of a set of data, where  the variance is:
          (sum_of_the_squares -  (sum2 / number_of_elements)) / ( number_of_elements - 1)
 (as a quick test, if the data are [5 | 7 | 3 | 6 | 6 | 2 | 5], the standard deviation should be 1.772810520855837).
Include this saved program file with your project.
